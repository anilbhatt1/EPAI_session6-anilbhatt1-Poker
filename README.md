# Default Values
	We can provide default values to the function arguments. Once we provide a default value to a function argument, the argument becomes optional during the function call, which means it is not mandatory to pass that argument during function call. Letâ€™s take an example to understand this concept.

## Docstrings 
	Python documentation string or commonly known as docstring, is a string literal, and it is used in the class, module, function, or method definition. Docstrings are accessible from the doc attribute (__doc__) for any of the Python objects and also with the built-in help() function. An object's docstring is defined by including a string constant as the first statement in the object's definition.
    Docstrings are great for understanding the functionality of the larger part of the code, i.e., the general purpose of any class, module, or function, whereas the comments are used for code, statement, and expressions, which tend to be small. They are a descriptive text written by a programmer mainly for themselves to know what the line of code or expression does and also for the developer who wishes to contribute to that project. It is an essential part that documenting your code is going to serve well enough for writing clean code and well-written programs.

## Annotations
	* Function annotations, both for parameters and return values, are completely optional.

	* Function annotations are nothing more than a way of associating arbitrary Python expressions with various parts of a function at compile-time.

	* By itself, Python does not attach any particular meaning or significance to annotations

	* The PEP-3107 makes no attempt to introduce any kind of standard semantics, even for the built-in types. All this work left to the third-party libraries.

## Lambda Expression
	A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

	A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
